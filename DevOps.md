   - **GitHub**, **GitLab**, **Bitbucket** (platforms built around Git for collaboration and hosting repositories)

### 2. **Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Tools**
   - **Jenkins** (open-source automation server) 
   - **GitLab CI** (integrated with GitLab)
   - **CircleCI** (cloud-based CI/CD)
   - **Travis CI**
   - **Azure DevOps** (Microsoft's CI/CD toolchain)
   - **TeamCity** (JetBrains' CI server)
   - **GitHub Actions** (for automating workflows)

### 3. **Containerization Tools**
   - **Docker** (container platform for packaging applications)
   - **Podman** (alternative to Docker)
   - **Kubernetes** (for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications)
   - **OpenShift** (Red Hat's enterprise Kubernetes platform)

### 4. **Configuration Management Tools**
   - **Ansible** (simple, agentless automation tool)

   - **Datadog** (cloud-scale monitoring and analytics)
   - **New Relic** (application performance monitoring)
   - **Splunk** (data analytics and monitoring)

### 7. **Cloud Platforms (for DevOps services)**
   - **AWS** (Amazon Web Services, offers DevOps services like CodePipeline, CodeBuild, etc.)
   - **Microsoft Azure** (offers Azure DevOps services, AKS, etc.)
   - **Google Cloud Platform** (Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Build, etc.)

### 8. **Collaboration and Communication Tools**
   - **Slack** (for communication and integration with DevOps tools)
   - **Microsoft Teams** (for team collaboration)
   - **Trello**, **Jira** (for project management)

### 9. **Security Tools (DevSecOps)**
