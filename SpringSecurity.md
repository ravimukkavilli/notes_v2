In a Spring Security setup for username/password-based authentication, where user data can be saved either in a database (DB) or Active Directory (AD), the authentication sequence involves several key components and methods. Here’s a step-by-step overview of the sequence that Spring Security follows:

1. **Username and Password Submission**:
   - The user submits their username and password, typically through a login form.
   - The request reaches a Spring Security filter, commonly the `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`.

2. **UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.attemptAuthentication**:
   - `attemptAuthentication(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)` method extracts the username and password from the request.
   - It then creates a `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` with the provided credentials and passes it to the `AuthenticationManager` for authentication.

3. **AuthenticationManager.authenticate**:
   - The `AuthenticationManager` (often `ProviderManager`) is responsible for delegating the authentication to one or more `AuthenticationProvider`s.
   - If you have multiple sources (e.g., DB and AD), you may configure multiple `AuthenticationProvider`s, such as `DaoAuthenticationProvider` for DB-based authentication and `ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider` for AD.

4. **AuthenticationProvider.authenticate**:
   - Each `AuthenticationProvider` attempts to authenticate using its configured source.
   - In the case of `DaoAuthenticationProvider`:
     - It retrieves user details via a `UserDetailsService`.
     - Verifies the password with the configured `PasswordEncoder`.
   - In the case of `ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider`:
     - It connects to Active Directory and attempts to authenticate the user directly.

5. **UserDetailsService.loadUserByUsername** (for DB-based authentication):
   - If the `DaoAuthenticationProvider` is in use, it calls the `loadUserByUsername(String username)` method of the `UserDetailsService` to retrieve user information from the database.
   - This method returns a `UserDetails` object containing the user’s credentials and authorities.
   - Spring Security then verifies the password in `DaoAuthenticationProvider.additionalAuthenticationChecks`.

6. **PasswordEncoder.matches**:
   - If the `AuthenticationProvider` retrieved user details, it uses the configured `PasswordEncoder` to verify if the provided password matches the stored (hashed) password.
   - For database-based authentication, this step ensures the password is correct.
   - For Active Directory, this step may be skipped as AD handles authentication directly.

7. **Successful Authentication**:
   - If authentication is successful, the `AuthenticationManager` returns a fully populated `Authentication` object with details about the authenticated user.
   - This object is stored in the `SecurityContext` (accessible via `SecurityContextHolder`), marking the user as authenticated for subsequent requests.

8. **Failure Handling**:
   - If authentication fails (e.g., due to incorrect credentials or user not found), the process raises an `AuthenticationException`.
   - The `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter` catches this exception and typically redirects the user to a login error page.

### Example of Configuring DB and AD Authentication in Spring Security

In a Spring configuration class, you might configure both DB-based and AD-based authentication providers like this:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    private DataSource dataSource;

    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        // Database-based authentication
        auth.jdbcAuthentication()
            .dataSource(dataSource)
            .usersByUsernameQuery("SELECT username, password, enabled FROM users WHERE username = ?")
            .authoritiesByUsernameQuery("SELECT username, authority FROM authorities WHERE username = ?")
            .passwordEncoder(passwordEncoder());

        // Active Directory authentication
        auth.authenticationProvider(activeDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider());
    }

    @Bean
    public ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider activeDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider() {
        ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider provider =
                new ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider("domain.com", "ldap://domain.com/");
        provider.setConvertSubErrorCodesToExceptions(true);
        provider.setUseAuthenticationRequestCredentials(true);
        return provider;
    }

    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }
}
```

In this configuration:
- **JDBC Authentication**: Configures the database-based authentication using a custom query to fetch user and authority information from tables.
- **Active Directory Authentication**: Configures the `ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider` to handle authentication requests for AD.
- **PasswordEncoder**: Specifies a `BCryptPasswordEncoder` to hash and validate passwords.

With this setup, `AuthenticationManager` tries each configured `AuthenticationProvider` (DB first, then AD) until it finds a match.

--------

In Spring Security, the `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`, `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`, and `AuthenticationProvider` objects play crucial roles in handling username/password-based authentication. Here’s how and where each of these components is created, configured, and registered:

### 1. `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`

- **Purpose**: The `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter` is responsible for intercepting login requests, extracting credentials (username and password), and initiating the authentication process.
- **Creation and Configuration**: 
  - By default, this filter is automatically added by Spring Security when form-based login is enabled.
  - If you’re using `http.formLogin()` in your security configuration, Spring Security registers this filter with the `/login` URL (or a custom URL if specified).
- **Customization**:
  - If you need custom behavior, you can extend `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter` to override methods like `attemptAuthentication`.
  - You can then manually register this custom filter in the security configuration, usually in a class that extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`:
  
    ```java
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .addFilterBefore(new CustomUsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter(), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class)
            .formLogin()
                .loginProcessingUrl("/custom-login");  // Custom login URL
    }
    ```

- **Registration**:
  - By default, `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter` is registered automatically as part of the filter chain when `http.formLogin()` is enabled.
  - You can also manually register it with `http.addFilterBefore()` or `http.addFilterAfter()` if you need to customize its behavior or add it at a different point in the filter chain.

### 2. `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`

- **Purpose**: This token represents the username and password credentials during the authentication process. It is the main authentication token for username/password-based logins.
- **Creation**: 
  - The `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` is created within `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`. When `attemptAuthentication()` is called, it extracts the username and password from the request and uses them to create a new `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`.
  - For example:

    ```java
    public Authentication attemptAuthentication(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
        String username = obtainUsername(request);
        String password = obtainPassword(request);
        UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authRequest = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(username, password);
        return this.getAuthenticationManager().authenticate(authRequest);
    }
    ```

- **Usage**:
  - Once the `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` is created, it’s passed to the `AuthenticationManager` to perform the actual authentication.
  - If authentication is successful, a fully populated (authenticated) `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` is returned with the user’s details and authorities.

### 3. `AuthenticationManager` and `AuthenticationProvider`

- **AuthenticationManager**:
  - The `AuthenticationManager` is the central component that orchestrates the authentication process. It delegates the actual authentication to one or more `AuthenticationProvider` instances.
  - Spring Security’s default `AuthenticationManager` implementation is `ProviderManager`, which manages a list of `AuthenticationProvider`s and attempts to authenticate using each provider in sequence.
  - `AuthenticationManager` can be customized or replaced by creating a `@Bean` of type `AuthenticationManager` in your security configuration.

- **AuthenticationProvider**:
  - **Purpose**: `AuthenticationProvider` is responsible for the actual authentication logic. Examples include `DaoAuthenticationProvider` (for database authentication) and `ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider` (for Active Directory).
  - **Registration and Configuration**:
    - `AuthenticationProviders` are registered with the `AuthenticationManagerBuilder` in the security configuration class. Typically, this is done in a class that extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`.
    - For example:

      ```java
      @Override
      protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
          auth.authenticationProvider(daoAuthenticationProvider());
          auth.authenticationProvider(activeDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider());
      }

      @Bean
      public DaoAuthenticationProvider daoAuthenticationProvider() {
          DaoAuthenticationProvider provider = new DaoAuthenticationProvider();
          provider.setUserDetailsService(customUserDetailsService);
          provider.setPasswordEncoder(passwordEncoder());
          return provider;
      }

      @Bean
      public ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider activeDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider() {
          return new ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider("domain.com", "ldap://domain.com/");
      }
      ```

- **How `AuthenticationProvider`s Are Used**:
  - Each `AuthenticationProvider` is tried in the order they were registered. If one provider cannot authenticate, the next is tried. If none can authenticate, an `AuthenticationException` is thrown.
  - `DaoAuthenticationProvider` uses a `UserDetailsService` to load user details (username, password, roles) from a database or other storage.
  - `ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider` directly interacts with an Active Directory to authenticate the user.

### Summary of the Sequence

1. **User submits credentials** → `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter` intercepts the request.
2. **Create `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`** → The filter creates a token with the provided credentials.
3. **Authenticate with `AuthenticationManager`** → The token is passed to the `AuthenticationManager`, which tries each registered `AuthenticationProvider`.
4. **`AuthenticationProvider` authenticates**:
   - If it’s `DaoAuthenticationProvider`, it fetches user details via `UserDetailsService` and verifies the password.
   - If it’s `ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider`, it directly checks against AD.
5. **Authentication result**:
   - If successful, the `Authentication` object is stored in the `SecurityContextHolder`.
   - If unsuccessful, an `AuthenticationException` is thrown.

This structure allows for flexible configurations where multiple `AuthenticationProvider`s can handle different types of credentials or user stores, such as a mix of database and AD-based authentication.

--------

Yes, that’s correct! After successful authentication, the `Authentication` object in Spring Security is indeed typically an instance of `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`, which implements the `Authentication` interface.

Here’s how this works:

1. **Pre-Authentication**: During the login attempt, a `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` is first created with the user's credentials (username and password) and **is unauthenticated**. This token is passed to the `AuthenticationManager` for processing.

    ```java
    UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authRequest = 
        new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(username, password);
    ```

2. **Authentication Process**:
   - The `AuthenticationManager` (usually through an `AuthenticationProvider` like `DaoAuthenticationProvider`) processes this token.
   - The provider verifies the credentials and retrieves the user’s details (like roles and authorities) from a `UserDetailsService`.
   - If authentication is successful, it returns a fully populated `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` object, now with authentication set to **true**.

3. **Post-Authentication**: 
   - This returned `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` is an **authenticated token** (it contains the `Principal`, roles/authorities, and the authenticated status).
   - It is this **authenticated `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`** that is then stored in the `SecurityContext`.

4. **Storage in SecurityContext**: 
   - The `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter` places this authenticated token (an instance of `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`) into the `SecurityContextHolder`.

   ```java
   SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication);
   ```

### Why `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` Implements `Authentication`

- `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` implements `Authentication` to standardize the way authentication data is handled in Spring Security.
- The `Authentication` interface provides a general contract, which `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` fulfills by providing methods to retrieve:
  - The `Principal` (usually the `UserDetails` object).
  - Credentials (the password, if needed).
  - Roles/authorities (granted authorities).
  - The authentication status (whether the token is authenticated).

### Summary

So, after a successful username/password authentication, the `Authentication` object is indeed typically an instance of `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`. It’s authenticated, populated with user details and authorities, and stored in the `SecurityContextHolder` for use throughout the request.

No problem! Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how the JWT-based authentication flow works in your scenario, where the JWT is provided in the HTTP header for a REST API call to a `NotificationService`. This JWT, created by the `CustomSecurityService` during user login, needs to be verified by `CustomSecurityService` before `NotificationService` can proceed with the request.

### JWT-Based Authentication Flow for NotificationService

#### 1. **User Login and JWT Generation**

- **User Submits Credentials**: The user sends a login request with their credentials (username and password) to the `CustomSecurityService`.

- **Authentication Process**:
  - The `CustomSecurityService` authenticates the user by verifying the credentials against a user store (e.g., database or LDAP).
  - Upon successful authentication, `CustomSecurityService` generates a JWT, which includes:
    - **Claims**: Such as the subject (user ID), roles, and expiration time.
    - **Signature**: Signed with a secret key to ensure integrity.

- **Return JWT to User**: The generated JWT is sent back to the user as part of the login response.

#### 2. **Client Makes a Request to NotificationService**

- **Client Sends Request**: The client makes a REST API call to `NotificationService` to perform some action (e.g., fetching notifications), including the JWT in the HTTP Authorization header:

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
  ```

#### Step 3: JWT Verification in NotificationService

##### JWT Filter or Interceptor Configuration

1. **JWT Filter**: 
   - A custom filter, such as `JwtAuthorizationFilter`, is created that extends `OncePerRequestFilter` or implements `Filter`.
   - This filter is responsible for intercepting HTTP requests and checking for the presence of a JWT in the Authorization header.

2. **Filter Configuration**: 
   - In your Spring Security configuration class (typically extending `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`), you register the `JwtAuthorizationFilter` to ensure it processes requests before they reach the controller.

   ```java
   @Configuration
   @EnableWebSecurity
   public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

       @Autowired
       private JwtAuthorizationFilter jwtAuthorizationFilter;

       @Override
       protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
           http
               .csrf().disable()
               .authorizeRequests()
               .anyRequest().authenticated() // Require authentication for all requests
               .and()
               .addFilterBefore(jwtAuthorizationFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Filter Logic**: In the `doFilterInternal` method of the `JwtAuthorizationFilter`, you implement the logic to extract and verify the JWT.

#### Step 4: Verify JWT Using CustomSecurityService

#### JWT Verification Process

1. **Extracting the JWT**:
   - The filter extracts the JWT from the Authorization header. If it's not present or improperly formatted, it can return a 401 Unauthorized response.
   
   ```java
   String header = request.getHeader("Authorization");
   if (header == null || !header.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
       response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_UNAUTHORIZED, "Authorization header must be provided");
       return;
   }
   String token = header.substring(7); // Extract the token
   ```

2. **JWT Verification Logic**:
   - The filter calls a method in `CustomSecurityService` to verify the JWT. This service could be a Spring service annotated with `@Service`.

   ```java
   @Service
   public class CustomSecurityService {

       private final String secretKey = "your-secret-key"; // Load this from a config source

       public Claims verifyToken(String token) {
           // Decode the token using a library like JJWT
           return Jwts.parser()
                   .setSigningKey(secretKey)
                   .parseClaimsJws(token)
                   .getBody();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Handling Verification Results**:
   - If the token is valid, you retrieve the claims (user information, roles, etc.) and check if the user is still active (if needed).
   - If the token is expired or invalid, you can return a 401 Unauthorized response from the filter.

#### Step 5: Set Authentication in Security Context

##### Setting Up the Security Context

1. **Creating the Authentication Object**:
   - Once the JWT is validated, you create an `Authentication` object. You typically use `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`, but it can also be a custom token class if needed.

   ```java
   Claims claims = customSecurityService.verifyToken(token);
   String username = claims.getSubject(); // Get user identifier
   List<GrantedAuthority> authorities = ... // Map roles from claims to GrantedAuthority
   Authentication authentication = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(username, null, authorities);
   ```

2. **Storing the Authentication in SecurityContext**:
   - After creating the `Authentication` object, you store it in the `SecurityContextHolder`, which is a thread-local variable that holds the security context for the current request.

   ```java
   SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication);
   ```

3. **Configuration for SecurityContext Persistence**:
   - Ensure that your security configuration has stateless session management to avoid storing user sessions on the server, which is common in JWT implementations.

   ```java
   http.sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS);
   ```

#### 6. **Proceed with the Request in NotificationService**

- **Access Control**:
  - Now that the `Authentication` object is set, Spring Security allows the request to proceed.
  - The `NotificationService` can access the user's details and roles from the `SecurityContext` as needed.

- **Perform Action**:
  - The `NotificationService` processes the request (e.g., retrieving notifications for the authenticated user) using the information from the `Authentication` object.

#### 7. **Response to Client**

- **Return Response**:
  - After processing the request, `NotificationService` constructs a response (e.g., a list of notifications) and sends it back to the client.

### Summary

- **User Login**: User submits credentials to `CustomSecurityService`, which generates and returns a JWT upon successful authentication.
- **Client Request**: The client sends a request to `NotificationService` with the JWT in the Authorization header.
- **JWT Verification**: A filter in `NotificationService` extracts and verifies the JWT by calling `CustomSecurityService`.
- **Authentication Setup**: If valid, the filter creates an `Authentication` object and stores it in `SecurityContextHolder`.
- **Service Processing**: `NotificationService` processes the request based on the authenticated user’s context.
- **Response**: The service returns the appropriate response to the client.

This flow allows for secure and stateless authentication using JWTs, enabling the `NotificationService` to trust the authentication performed by `CustomSecurityService`. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!


-----

To implement authorization in your `NotificationService` where the `getNotifications` endpoint requires the user to have the role of "ADMIN" and for the `companyId` in the claims to match the `companyId` in the request, you can leverage Spring Security’s method-level security or use a combination of the security filter and custom access decision logic. Below are the steps to configure this:

### 1. Enable Method Security

First, ensure that method security is enabled in your Spring configuration. This allows you to use annotations like `@PreAuthorize` to secure your endpoints based on roles and custom logic.

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.method.configuration.EnableGlobalMethodSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;

@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true) // Enable method-level security
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    // Other configurations...
}
```

### 2. Create a Controller for Notifications

In your `NotificationService`, create a controller that handles the `getNotifications` endpoint. Use the `@PreAuthorize` annotation to enforce the role and company ID checks.

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.security.access.prepost.PreAuthorize;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/notifications")
public class NotificationController {

    @Autowired
    private NotificationService notificationService;

    @GetMapping("/{companyId}")
    @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN') and #companyId == authentication.name") // Assuming username holds companyId
    public List<Notification> getNotifications(@PathVariable String companyId) {
        return notificationService.getNotifications(companyId);
    }
}
```

### 3. Custom Access Decision Logic

If you want to perform a more complex check (like comparing the `companyId` from the claims to the one in the request), you might consider implementing a custom access decision voter or service.

#### Custom Voter Implementation

You can create a custom `AccessDecisionVoter` that checks both the role and the company ID.

```java
import org.springframework.security.access.AccessDecisionVoter;
import org.springframework.security.access.prepost.PreAuthorize;
import org.springframework.security.core.Authentication;
import org.springframework.security.core.GrantedAuthority;
import org.springframework.security.web.access.intercept.FilterInvocation;

import java.util.Collection;

public class CompanyAccessDecisionVoter implements AccessDecisionVoter<FilterInvocation> {

    @Override
    public int vote(Authentication authentication, FilterInvocation invocation, Collection<ConfigAttribute> attributes) {
        String companyIdFromRequest = invocation.getRequest().getParameter("companyId"); // Assuming companyId is passed as a request parameter

        if (authentication != null) {
            boolean isAdmin = authentication.getAuthorities().stream()
                    .anyMatch(authority -> authority.getAuthority().equals("ROLE_ADMIN"));
            // Assuming companyId is stored in the principal or claims
            String companyIdFromClaims = ((ClaimsResponse) authentication.getPrincipal()).getCompanyId(); // Replace with actual logic to extract companyId from claims

            if (isAdmin && companyIdFromClaims.equals(companyIdFromRequest)) {
                return ACCESS_GRANTED;
            }
        }

        return ACCESS_DENIED;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean supports(ConfigAttribute attribute) {
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean supports(Class<?> clazz) {
        return FilterInvocation.class.isAssignableFrom(clazz);
    }
}
```

#### Registering the Custom Voter

Register your custom access decision voter in your Spring Security configuration.

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.web.access.expression.WebExpressionVoter;

@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and()
            .accessDecisionManager(accessDecisionManager());
    }

    @Bean
    public AccessDecisionManager accessDecisionManager() {
        List<AccessDecisionVoter<?>> decisionVoters = new ArrayList<>();
        decisionVoters.add(new CompanyAccessDecisionVoter());
        decisionVoters.add(new WebExpressionVoter()); // Enable SpEL expressions

        return new AffirmativeBased(decisionVoters);
    }
}
```

### 4. Controller Authorization with Role and Company ID Check

With this setup, the authorization check in your controller will ensure that only users with the "ADMIN" role who belong to the specified `companyId` can access the `getNotifications` endpoint.

### Summary

- **Method-Level Security**: Enabled using `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity`.
- **Controller**: Uses `@PreAuthorize` to enforce that the user has the "ADMIN" role and that the `companyId` matches.
- **Custom Access Decision Voter**: Implements more complex authorization logic, allowing you to check both roles and specific claim values.
- **Security Configuration**: Registers the custom voter with Spring Security.

This approach provides a robust way to handle role-based and claim-based access control in your microservices architecture. If you need more details or further assistance, feel free to ask!
