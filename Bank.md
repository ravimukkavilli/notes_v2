Here's a detailed breakdown for designing a secure internet banking application for a multinational bank:

---

### **1. Define Actors**

1. **Customer**:
   - End-user who can view their balance, deposit, and withdraw money from their account.

2. **Branch Manager**:
   - Authorized bank employee responsible for onboarding new customers and opening savings accounts.

3. **Admin**:
   - Bank's central authority for managing user roles, permissions, and application configurations.

4. **System**:
   - Backend system for handling transactions, notifications, security, and database operations.

---

### **2. Use Cases**

1. **Customer Use Cases**:
   - View Account Balance
   - Deposit Money
   - Withdraw Money

2. **Branch Manager Use Cases**:
   - Onboard New Customer
   - Open Savings Account

3. **Admin Use Cases**:
   - Manage Roles and Permissions
   - Monitor Application Usage and Logs

4. **System Use Cases**:
   - Validate and Log Transactions
   - Authenticate and Authorize Users
   - Monitor and Report Application Health

---

### **3. Functional Requirements**

1. **User Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Secure login using multi-factor authentication (MFA).
   - Role-based access for Customers, Branch Managers, and Admins.

2. **Account Management**:
   - View current balance.
   - Deposit and withdraw money with real-time transaction validation.
   - Display detailed transaction history.

3. **Customer Onboarding**:
   - Branch managers should register new customers and open accounts through an interface with a document upload feature.

4. **Audit Logs**:
   - Record all transactions, logins, and sensitive operations with timestamps for compliance and audit purposes.

---

### **4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

1. **Security**:
   - Use HTTPS/TLS encryption for data in transit.
   - Encrypt sensitive data (PII, account details) at rest.
   - Implement rate limiting, intrusion detection, and vulnerability scans.

2. **Performance**:
   - API response time should be < 200 ms for standard operations.
   - Support up to 1000 concurrent users with smooth scaling on-demand.

3. **Availability**:
   - 99.99% uptime with a disaster recovery plan in place, including backups and geo-redundancy.

4. **Compliance**:
   - Ensure compliance with financial regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS, SOC 2).

5. **Scalability**:
   - Dynamic scaling to handle peak loads, particularly for customer-related transactions.

---

### **5. Resource Estimations**

1. **Storage**:
   - **Transactional Data**: ~500 GB/month (scalable with data growth).
   - **Document Storage**: ~1 TB/year for customer onboarding documentation.
   - **Audit Logs**: ~100 GB/year for security and compliance.

2. **APIs**:
   - ~50 API endpoints, including high-traffic endpoints for transactions and data retrieval.

---

### **6. APIs**

- **Authentication API**:
  - `/api/auth/login`: User login with MFA.
  - `/api/auth/logout`: User logout.

- **Customer APIs**:
  - `/api/customer/balance`: View current balance.
  - `/api/customer/deposit`: Deposit funds.
  - `/api/customer/withdraw`: Withdraw funds.

- **Branch Manager APIs**:
  - `/api/branch/onboard`: Onboard a new customer.
  - `/api/branch/openAccount`: Open a savings account.

- **Admin APIs**:
  - `/api/admin/roles`: Manage user roles.
  - `/api/admin/logs`: Access audit logs.

---

### **7. Low-Level Design (LLD)**

- **Authentication**:
  - Implement OAuth2 for secure token management and authorization.
  - Use JWT for session management and enforce expiration times.

- **Database Design**:
  - **Customer Table**: `customer_id`, `name`, `address`, `phone`, `email`.
  - **Account Table**: `account_id`, `customer_id`, `balance`, `account_type`.
  - **Transaction Table**: `transaction_id`, `account_id`, `amount`, `type`, `timestamp`.

- **API Design**:
  - Each API endpoint should validate input data and enforce role-based permissions.
  - Implement circuit breakers for external API dependencies (e.g., SMS for MFA).

---

### **8. High-Level Design (HLD)**

- **Architecture**:
  - Microservices architecture on Azure, with separate services for authentication, transaction processing, and customer management.
  - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for container orchestration.
  - Azure Blob Storage for storing documents uploaded during onboarding.

- **Data Flow**:
  - **Transaction Processing**: Real-time validation of transaction requests through API Gateway, routed to transaction service.
  - **Security Layer**: Use Azure AD B2C for MFA and secure role-based access management.
  - **Data Persistence**: Use Azure SQL Database for relational data (e.g., customer, account) and Azure Cosmos DB for faster read access to account details and transaction history.

---

### **9. Handling Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Security**:
  - TLS encryption for data in transit and AES encryption for sensitive data at rest.
  - Use of Azure Sentinel for monitoring and alerting on suspicious activity.

- **Performance & Scalability**:
  - API caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., account balance).
  - Autoscaling on Azure Kubernetes Service to accommodate traffic spikes.

- **Compliance**:
  - Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.
  - Azure Policy and Azure Blueprints for compliance checks.

---

### **10. Future Readiness**

1. **Feature Expansion**:
   - Support for additional transaction types like fund transfers and bill payments.
   - Integration with third-party financial services.

2. **AI & Analytics**:
   - Use Azure Machine Learning for fraud detection and risk scoring.
   - Real-time analytics for customer behavior insights.

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - Plan for mobile applications with responsive web design and a seamless API-based backend.

This design supports a scalable and secure internet banking solution with robust role-based access, security, compliance, and the capability for future enhancements.
