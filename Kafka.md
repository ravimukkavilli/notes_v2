# Apache Kafka Interview Questions

### 1. What is Apache Kafka, and what are its main use cases?
**Answer:**  
Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used for real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It provides high-throughput, fault-tolerant, low-latency streaming.

### 2. Explain the key components of Kafka.
**Answer:**  
- **Producer:** Sends messages to Kafka topics.  
- **Consumer:** Reads messages from topics.  
- **Broker:** A Kafka server that stores data and serves consumers and producers.  
- **Topic:** A stream of records (similar to a table in a database).  
- **Partition:** A topic is divided into partitions to distribute load.  
- **Zookeeper:** Manages metadata, leader election, and broker coordination (deprecated from Kafka 3.0).

### 3. What is a Kafka topic?
**Answer:**  
A topic in Kafka is a category or feed name to which records are published. Producers write data to topics, and consumers read data from them. Each topic is divided into partitions for scalability.

### 4. What is a Kafka partition?
**Answer:**  
A partition is a division of a Kafka topic. Each partition contains an ordered sequence of records, and Kafka guarantees ordering only within a single partition, not across the entire topic. This allows topics to scale horizontally.

### 5. How does Kafka ensure message ordering?
**Answer:**  
Kafka ensures ordering of messages within a partition by appending messages in the order they are produced. Consumers read messages in the same order, ensuring consistency. However, Kafka doesn’t guarantee ordering across partitions, only within them.

### 6. What is a Kafka consumer group?
**Answer:**  
A consumer group is a group of consumers that work together to consume messages from topics. Kafka ensures that each partition of a topic is consumed by only one consumer within a consumer group, allowing for load balancing.

### 7. Explain Kafka’s producer acknowledgment modes.
**Answer:**  
Kafka provides three acknowledgment modes:
- **acks=0:** Producer does not wait for an acknowledgment from the broker.  
- **acks=1:** Producer waits for an acknowledgment from the leader of the partition.  
- **acks=all:** Producer waits for acknowledgment from all in-sync replicas (guaranteeing durability).

### 8. How does Kafka handle fault tolerance?
**Answer:**  
Kafka achieves fault tolerance through replication. Each partition in Kafka is replicated across multiple brokers, and one of the replicas is elected as the leader. If the leader fails, another replica takes over as the leader.

### 9. What is a Kafka broker?
**Answer:**  
A Kafka broker is a server that stores data (messages) and serves requests from producers and consumers. Kafka brokers can handle thousands of partitions and millions of messages per second.

### 10. What is Zookeeper’s role in Kafka?
**Answer:**  
Zookeeper manages and coordinates Kafka brokers, tracks the status of brokers, and helps with leader election of partitions. It is also responsible for storing metadata about topics, partitions, and offsets (now deprecated in Kafka 3.0).

### 11. How does Kafka achieve high throughput?
**Answer:**  
Kafka achieves high throughput through:
- **Partitioning:** Distributing data across multiple brokers.
- **Asynchronous Writes:** Allowing producers to continue writing without waiting for acknowledgments.

### 12. What is the difference between Kafka and traditional messaging systems?
**Answer:**  
Traditional messaging systems (e.g., RabbitMQ) generally focus on point-to-point or publish-subscribe models with strict message delivery guarantees. Kafka is designed for high-throughput distributed streaming and focuses on durability, scalability, and low-latency with partitioned topics and offset tracking.

### 13. What is ISR (In-Sync Replica) in Kafka?
**Answer:**  
ISR (In-Sync Replica) is a set of replicas that are fully synchronized with the leader. If a leader fails, one of the replicas from the ISR can be promoted to leader, ensuring minimal data loss.

### 14. How does Kafka handle message retention?
**Answer:**  
Kafka allows message retention based on time (e.g., messages are kept for 7 days) or size (e.g., retain up to 100 GB of data per topic). Kafka also supports log compaction, which keeps only the latest update for each key.

### 15. How do you monitor Kafka performance?
**Answer:**  
Kafka can be monitored using metrics from tools like JMX, Prometheus, Grafana, or via logs. Key metrics include:
- Broker throughput
- Latency
- Message consumption rates
- Replication lag
- Consumer lag

### 16. What is the difference between a Kafka producer and a Kafka consumer?
**Answer:**  
- **Producer:** Writes data to Kafka topics.  
- **Consumer:** Reads data from Kafka topics.

### 17. How does Kafka achieve exactly-once delivery semantics?
**Answer:**  
Kafka achieves exactly-once semantics (EOS) through idempotent producers and transactional APIs. Idempotent producers ensure that duplicates are not written to Kafka. Transactions allow producers and consumers to commit both data and offsets atomically.

### 18. What are log compaction and segment retention in Kafka?
**Answer:**  
- **Log Compaction:** Kafka retains the latest value for each key in the topic, removing older duplicates. It’s useful for change data capture.  
- **Segment Retention:** Kafka splits logs into segments, and messages older than a certain period (or size) are deleted.

### 19. How do you scale Kafka producers and consumers?
**Answer:**  
Kafka producers can be scaled by creating more producer instances. Kafka consumers scale by adding more consumers to a consumer group. Kafka automatically assigns partitions to new consumers when they join a consumer group. This depends on the number of partitions the topic has.

### 20. What is the role of Kafka Streams?
**Answer:**  
Kafka Streams is a client library for building stream processing applications. It allows developers to transform, aggregate, filter, and enrich data in real-time as it is ingested from Kafka topics.

### 21. Explain how Kafka’s replication works.
**Answer:**  
Kafka replicates each partition to multiple brokers to ensure fault tolerance. One of the replicas is elected as the leader, and others are followers. Producers write to the leader, and followers replicate the data to ensure consistency.

### 22. What is a Kafka offset, and how is it managed?
**Answer:**  
A Kafka offset is a unique identifier for each message in a partition. Consumers use offsets to keep track of which messages have been consumed. Kafka offsets can be managed manually or automatically (through consumer groups).

### 23. How do you configure Kafka for high availability?
**Answer:**
- Replicate topics across multiple brokers.
- Use multiple brokers in the cluster to avoid single points of failure.
- Enable replication factor greater than 1 for critical topics.
- Use ISR (In-Sync Replicas) for fault tolerance.

### 24. What is the difference between Kafka and RabbitMQ?
**Answer:**  
Kafka is designed for distributed event streaming, offering high throughput and horizontal scalability with partitioned topics, while RabbitMQ is a traditional message broker designed for smaller, simpler messaging tasks with strong delivery guarantees.

### 25. How do you manage schema evolution in Kafka?
**Answer:**  
Kafka can use Schema Registry to manage schema evolution. Producers and consumers use schemas to ensure compatibility. The Schema Registry ensures that new data is backward-compatible with older consumers.

### 26. What is the role of Kafka Connect?
**Answer:**  
Kafka Connect is a tool to stream data between Kafka and other systems, such as databases and data lakes. It simplifies integration by providing connectors for common data sources and sinks.

### 27. How do Kafka producers handle retries and failures?
**Answer:**  
Kafka producers can be configured to retry sending messages upon failures. Kafka also supports idempotent producers, which ensures that duplicates are not produced during retries.

### 28. What is the Kafka rebalance process?
**Answer:**  
Rebalancing occurs when a consumer joins or leaves a consumer group. Kafka redistributes partitions among the available consumers to balance the load.

### 29. How can Kafka be integrated with other data processing systems?
**Answer:**  
Kafka can be integrated with other systems using Kafka Connect for simple integrations or Kafka Streams for real-time stream processing. Systems like Spark, Flink, and Hadoop can be integrated via connectors.
