## 1. Describe AI Workloads and Considerations (15–20%)

### 1.1 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
- **Definition**: AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by computers, including learning, reasoning, and self-correction.
- **Key AI Capabilities**:
  - **Learning**: Acquiring knowledge from data (e.g., ML models).
  - **Reasoning**: Making decisions based on learned knowledge.
  - **Perception**: Interpreting sensory data (e.g., vision, speech).
  - **Interaction**: Communicating with humans (e.g., chatbots).
- **AI Workloads**:
  - **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual patterns (e.g., fraud detection).
  - **Computer Vision**: Analyzing images/videos (e.g., object detection).
  - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Understanding text/speech (e.g., sentiment analysis).
  - **Knowledge Mining**: Extracting insights from unstructured data (e.g., document search).
  - **Generative AI**: Creating content (e.g., text, images).

### 1.2 Common AI Workload Scenarios
- **Anomaly Detection**: Used in finance (fraud detection), manufacturing (equipment failure), and cybersecurity.
- **Computer Vision**: Retail (inventory management), healthcare (medical imaging), security (facial recognition).
- **NLP**: Customer service (chatbots), marketing (sentiment analysis), legal (contract analysis).
- **Knowledge Mining**: Enterprise search, document summarization, compliance auditing.
- **Generative AI**: Content creation (marketing copy), design (image generation), coding (code suggestions).

### 1.3 Microsoft’s Principles of Responsible AI
Microsoft emphasizes ethical AI development through six guiding principles:
1. **Fairness**: AI systems should treat all people equitably, avoiding bias based on gender, race, etc.
   - Example: Ensuring a hiring algorithm doesn’t favor one demographic.
2. **Reliability and Safety**: AI should perform consistently and safely under expected conditions.
   - Example: Autonomous vehicle AI must handle unexpected road conditions.
3. **Privacy and Security**: Protect user data and ensure secure AI systems.
   - Example: Encrypting personal data used in AI models.
4. **Inclusiveness**: AI should empower everyone, including people with disabilities.
   - Example: Providing captions in vision-based AI apps.
5. **Transparency**: Users should understand how AI makes decisions.
   - Example: Documenting how a loan approval AI works.
6. **Accountability**: Humans should oversee AI systems and be responsible for outcomes.
   - Example: Allowing human intervention in AI-driven medical diagnoses.

#### 1.3.1 Responsible AI examples
- An AI-powered college admissions system should be tested to ensure it evaluates all applications fairly, taking into account relevant academic criteria but avoiding unfounded discrimination based on irrelevant demographic factors.
- An AI-powered robotic solution that uses computer vision to detect objects should avoid unintentional harm or damage. One way to accomplish this goal is to use probability values to determine "confidence" in object identification before interacting with physical objects, and avoid any action if the confidence level is below a specific threshold.
- A facial identification system used in an airport or other secure area should delete personal images that are used for temporary access as soon as they're no longer required. Additionally, safeguards should prevent the images being made accessible to operators or users who have no need to view them.
- A web-based chatbot that offers speech-based interaction should also generate text captions to avoid making the system unusable for users with a hearing impairment.
- A bank that uses an AI-based loan-approval application should disclose the use of AI, and describe features of the data on which it was trained (without revealing confidential information).

### 1.4 Azure AI Services for Workloads

     - **Classification**: Predicts discrete categories (e.g., spam vs. not spam).
   - Example: Predicting customer churn (yes/no) based on historical data.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**:
   - Uses unlabeled data to find patterns.
   - Types:
     - **Clustering**: Groups similar data points (e.g., customer segmentation).
     - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Simplifies data while retaining key features (e.g., PCA).
   - Example: Grouping customers by purchasing behavior.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**:
