- Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. 

## Shared Responsibility Model
- With a traditional corporate datacenter. The company is responsible for maintaining the physical space, ensuring security, and maintaining or replacing the servers if anything happens.
- With the shared responsibility model, these responsibilities get shared between the cloud provider and the consumer.
- **When using a cloud provider, you’ll always be responsible for**:
  - The information and data stored in the cloud
  - Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
  - The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization
- **The cloud provider is always responsible for**:
  - The physical datacenter
  - The physical network
  - The physical hosts
- **Your service model will determine responsibility for things like**: (OnPrem, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
  - Operating systems
  - Network controls
  - Applications
  - Identity and infrastructure

## Cloud Models

  ### Private Cloud
  **Definition**: Dedicated to a single organization. . A private cloud is, in some ways, the natural evolution from a corporate datacenter. It’s a cloud (delivering IT services over the internet) that’s used by a single entity
    
  #### **Benefits**:
  - Agility
  - Quick deployment
  - Private, non-shared network
  - Greater control over costs
  
  #### **Drawbacks**:
  - High costs
  - Infrastructure owned by the cloud provider may raise privacy concerns
    
  ### Public Cloud
  **Definition**: Shared resources in a multi-tenant environment. A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider.
    
  #### **Benefits**:
  - Agility
  - Quick deployment
  
  #### **Drawbacks**:
  - Loss of control
  - Limited flexibility as the setups are pre-configured, and customers must choose from available options.
  - Shared infrastructure
  
  ### Hybrid Cloud
  **Definition**: A combination of public and private cloud environments. A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment.
  
  #### **Benefits**:
  - Flexibility to run some systems on-premises and others in the cloud
  - Supports legacy applications
  
  #### **Drawbacks**:
  - Complex to manage
  - Requires additional IT expertise

 ### Multi-cloud
 **Definition**: A fourth, and increasingly likely scenario is a multi-cloud scenario. In a multi-cloud scenario, you use multiple public cloud providers. Maybe you use different features from different cloud providers. Or maybe you started your cloud journey with one provider and are in the process of migrating to a different provider. Regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

 ### Azure Arc
 **Definition**: Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment. Azure Arc can help manage your cloud environment, whether it's a public cloud solely on Azure, a private cloud in your datacenter, a hybrid configuration, or even a multi-cloud environment running on multiple cloud providers at once.

 ### Azure VMware Solution
 **Definition**: What if you’re already established with VMware in a private cloud environment but want to migrate to a public or hybrid cloud? Azure VMware Solution lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.

### Consumption-Based Pricing Model

- When comparing IT infrastructure models, there are two types of expenses to consider. **Capital expenditure (CapEx)** and **Operational expenditure (OpEx)**.
- **CapEx** is typically a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle are examples of CapEx.
- **OpEx** is spending money on services or products over time. Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.
- Consumption-based model has many **benefits**, including:
  - No upfront costs.
  - No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
  - The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
  - The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.
    
- Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use
  

In this model, customers pay for the resources allocated to them, even if they aren't fully utilizing them.

**Guidelines**:
- Don't allocate more resources than necessary.
- Fully utilize the allocated resources.

## Describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud

- When you’re architecting your solution, you’ll need to account for service availability guarantees.
- uptime guarantees depending on the service, These guarantees are part of the service-level agreements (SLAs).

### Availability and Scalability

**Availability**:
- Ensures that applications and systems are accessible to users.

**Factors Affecting Availability**:
- Network outages
- Application failures
- System outages
- Power outages
- Dependencies like databases or third-party services

**High Availability** is typically considered as 99% or higher uptime.

**Scalability**:
- Scalability refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand. If you suddenly experience peak traffic and your systems are overwhelmed, the ability to scale means you can add more resources to better handle the increased demand. The other benefit of scalability is that you aren't overpaying for services. Because the cloud is a consumption-based model, you only pay for what you use.
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing or decreasing the capacity of existing resources (e.g., adding more CPU or RAM).
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding or removing instances of resources, such as moving from 1 VM to multiple VMs.

**Elasticity** in the cloud refers to the ability to scale resources up or down automatically as needed.


### Reliability and Predictability

- Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.
- With a decentralized design, the cloud enables you to have resources deployed in regions around the world. With this global scale, even if one region has a catastrophic event other regions are still up and running.
- Predictability can be focused on `performance predictability` or `cost predictability`. Both performance and cost predictability are heavily influenced by the _Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework_.
- **Performance predictability** focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers. Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability. If you suddenly need more resources, autoscaling can deploy additional resources to meet the demand, and then scale back when the demand drops. Or if the traffic is heavily focused on one area, load balancing will help redirect some of the overload to less stressed areas.
- **Cost predictability** is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend. With the cloud, you can track your resource use in real time, monitor resources to ensure that you’re using them in the most efficient way, and apply data analytics to find patterns and trends that help better plan resource deployments. You can even use tools like the `Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)` or `Pricing Calculator` to get an estimate of potential cloud spend.


### Security, Governance and Compliance

- Cloud features support governance and compliance. Things like set templates help ensure that all your deployed resources meet corporate standards and government regulatory requirements. Plus, you can update all your deployed resources to new standards as standards change.
- Cloud-based auditing helps flag any resource that’s out of compliance with your corporate standards and provides mitigation strategies.
- _If you want maximum control of security_, infrastructure as a service (**IaaS**) provides you with physical resources but lets you manage the operating systems and installed software, including patches and maintenance.
- _If you want patches and maintenance taken care of automatically_, platform as a service (**PaaS**) or software as a service (**SaaS**) deployments may be the best cloud strategies for you.

**Fault Tolerance (FT)**:
- Faults occur when a failure happens. Fault tolerance ensures systems maintain availability even in the event of a fault.

**Disasters**:
- A disaster is more impactful than a fault.
- Organizations should plan for disasters with a **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR)** plan.

### Manageability in Cloud

#### Management of the cloud
  Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources. In the cloud, you can
  - Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
  - Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
  - Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
  - Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so you’re aware of performance in real time.

#### Management in the cloud
  Management in the cloud speaks to how you’re able to manage your cloud environment and resources. You can manage these:
  - Through a web portal.
  - Using a command line interface.
  - Using APIs.
  - Using PowerShell.
  - Monitor services and resources.
  - Manage costs and budgets.
  - Scale resources as needed.
  - Easily deploy and manage resources.

## Cloud Service Types

### IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):
- Infrastructure as a service (**IaaS**) is the most flexible category of cloud services, as it provides you the maximum amount of control for your cloud resources. In an IaaS model, the cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the hardware, network connectivity (to the internet), and physical security. You’re responsible for everything else: operating system installation, configuration, and maintenance; network configuration; database and storage configuration; and so on. With IaaS, you’re essentially renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter, but what you do with that hardware is up to you.
- The cloud provider offers infrastructure, including hardware and networking components.
- Cost is based on consumption.
- Customers have the most responsibility and control, managing everything from the OS upwards.
- **Example**: Azure Virtual Machines (VMs).
- Some common scenarios where IaaS might make sense include:
  - Lift-and-shift migration: You’re setting up cloud resources similar to your on-prem datacenter, and then simply moving the things running on-prem to running on the IaaS infrastructure.
  - Testing and development: You have established configurations for development and test environments that you need to rapidly replicate. You can start up or shut down the different environments rapidly with an IaaS structure, while maintaining complete control.


### PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- Platform as a service (PaaS) is a middle ground between renting space in a datacenter (IaaS) and paying for a complete and deployed solution (SaaS).
- In a **PaaS** environment, the cloud provider maintains the physical infrastructure, physical security, and connection to the internet. They also maintain the operating systems, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services that make up a cloud solution. In a PaaS scenario, you don't have to worry about the licensing or patching for operating systems and databases. PaaS is well suited to provide a complete development environment without the headache of maintaining all the development infrastructure.
- The cloud provider supplies not only infrastructure but also the OS and middleware.
- Offers rich features and easy configuration.
- Ideal for customers who want to reduce the management burden.
- Provides a good balance of responsibility in the shared responsibility model.
- **Example**: Azure App Services.

### SaaS (Software as a Service)
- Software as a service (**SaaS**) is the most complete cloud service model from a product perspective. With SaaS, you’re essentially renting or using a fully developed application. 
- SaaS is the model that places the most responsibility with the cloud provider and the least responsibility with the user. In a SaaS environment you’re responsible for the data that you put into the system, the devices that you allow to connect to the system, and the users that have access. Nearly everything else falls to the cloud provider.
- The cloud provider manages the infrastructure, OS, and software.
- Often uses a pay-as-you-go model or is free.
- The customer has minimal responsibility and control.
- **Example**: Office 365.

## Regions and Availability

### Geography
- Conceptually, the datacenters are the same as large corporate datacenters. They’re facilities with resources arranged in racks, with dedicated power, cooling, and networking infrastructure.
- Datacenters are grouped into Azure Regions or Azure Availability Zones that are designed to help you achieve resiliency and reliability for your business-critical workloads.
- Azure divides the world into **geographies**, often based on country boundaries, to comply with local regulations. These can contain multiple regions.

### Region
- A **region** is a physical location within a geography.
- A region is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network. Azure intelligently assigns and controls the resources within each region to ensure workloads are appropriately balanced.
- Some services or virtual machine (VM) features are only available in certain regions, such as specific VM sizes or storage types. There are also some global Azure services that don't require you to select a particular region, such as _Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Traffic Manager, and Azure DNS_.
- Regions are connected to other regions in **region pairs** for disaster recovery.
- Most Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away. This approach allows for the replication of resources across a geography that helps reduce the likelihood of interruptions because of events such as natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages that affect an entire region.
- Examples of region pairs in Azure are West US paired with East US and South-East Asia paired with East Asia. Because the pair of regions are directly connected and far enough apart to be isolated from regional disasters, you can use them to provide reliable services and data redundancy.
- If a resource in a region fails, Azure automatically fails over to the paired region.

**Sovereign Regions**:
- Sovereign regions are instances of Azure that are isolated from the main instance of Azure. You may need to use a sovereign region for compliance or legal purposes.
- **US Government Region**: Isolated data centers for US government data.
  - All data stays in the US.
  - Only citizens are allowed to access system used to store data.
  - These data centers are seperated from Public data centers.
  - All employees in these data centers are screened.
  - There is also a dedicated network infra that is completly isolated from other networks.
  - Even cities and mucipalities can also use these DC as long as that can prove they are affliated to the GOVT.
- **Germany Region**: Created to comply with GDPR, operated by T-Systems International.
  - This is another special region, that was created for the compliance with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
  - This is availabile fro customers who are doing business in EU.
  - Alos available for the customers who are doing business in Europe Trade Association.
  - Available to UK.
  - Operated by company called T-Systems International, which is the data trustee, and has full control over all the data and infra.
  - MS Only manages systesm that have no access to customer data.
- **China Region**: Operated by Shanghai Blue Cloud Technology to comply with China's regulations.
  - This is another special region
  - Operated by company called Shanghai Blue Cloud technology, which is a data trustee, has full control over all the data and infra.
  - Created to have full compliance with China's regulations.

### **Availability Zones**
- Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. An availability zone is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks.
- Azure regions are made up of multiple **Availability Zones**, which are physically separate datacenters within a region.
- Each zone has its own power, cooling, and networking, making them independent of failures in other zones.
- **Key benefit**: Availability Zones protect against datacenter-level failures.
- Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases.

### Azure services that support availability zones fall into three categories:
#### **Zonal Services**
- A **zonal service** is deployed in a specific Availability Zone chosen by the user.
- **Example**: You deploy a Virtual Machine (VM) in Zone 1 of a region.
- **Advantages**:
  - Offers low latency for workloads that require zone-specific resources.
  - Provides predictable performance for applications that depend on proximity.
- **Limitation**:
  - If the specific zone experiences a failure, the resource in that zone will be unavailable.
  
**Examples of Zonal Services**:
  - Virtual Machines (VMs) with explicit zone placement.
  - Managed Disks deployed in a specific zone.


#### **Zone-Redundant Services**
- A **zone-redundant service** automatically replicates or distributes data and workloads across multiple Availability Zones within the region.
- **Example**: Azure SQL Database with zone-redundant configuration ensures data is replicated across zones.
- **Advantages**:
  - High availability: If one zone goes down, the service remains operational because it continues to run from another zone.
  - No need for manual intervention to achieve resiliency.
- **Limitation**:
  - May incur higher costs due to replication or distribution.
  
**Examples of Zone-Redundant Services**:
  - Azure Load Balancer with zone redundancy.
  - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with zone-redundant node pools.
  - Zone-redundant storage (ZRS).


**Always-available services** in Azure refer to platform-managed services that are inherently designed to provide high availability without requiring explicit configuration for resiliency or fault tolerance by the user. These services operate seamlessly across multiple **Availability Zones** or even **regions**, ensuring continuous availability.

#### Key Features of Always-Available Services
1. **Resiliency by Default**:
   - They are built to tolerate failures of individual datacenters, zones, or regions.
   - Users do not need to manage zone-specific deployments or configurations.

2. **Global Reach**:
   - Many always-available services are globally distributed, meaning they are not limited to a single region.
   - This provides an even higher level of availability compared to zone-redundant services.

3. **Managed by Azure**:
   - Azure handles all aspects of availability, including replication, failover, and disaster recovery.
   - Users benefit from high availability without added complexity.

4. **High SLA (Service Level Agreement)**:
   - These services often offer some of the highest SLAs in Azure, ensuring uptime commitments are met.

**Examples of Always-Available Services**

1. **Azure DNS**:
   - Always available globally, ensuring high availability for domain name resolution.

2. **Azure Traffic Manager**:
   - Routes traffic across multiple regions to ensure high availability and performance.

3. **Azure Front Door**:
   - Provides a globally distributed service for application delivery with automatic failover.

4. **Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)**:
   - Globally distributed service to deliver content with high availability.

5. **Azure Active Directory (AAD)**:
   - Built for global resiliency, ensuring authentication services are always available.


#### Key Differences

| **Aspect**               | **Zonal Services**                        | **Zone-Redundant Services**              | **Always-Available Services**             |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Cost**                 | Typically lower, as no redundancy is built-in. | Higher due to replication across zones.  | Varies, often included in service pricing but can be higher for global distribution. |
| **Deployment Scope**     | Single Availability Zone within a region. | Multiple Availability Zones in a region. | Regional or global, depending on the service. |
| **Resiliency**           | Limited to the selected zone; zone failure impacts availability. | Resilient to zone-level failures.        | Resilient across zones and potentially regions. |
| **Latency**              | Low for zone-specific workloads.          | Slightly higher due to cross-zone replication. | Optimized globally for consistent performance. |
| **User Configuration**   | Requires explicit zone selection during deployment. | User must configure redundancy (e.g., ZRS). | No configuration required; fully managed by Azure. |
| **High Availability**    | Limited; dependent on single zone health. | High; service remains operational if one zone fails. | Extremely high; service remains available even during region-wide issues. |
| **Disaster Recovery**    | Not inherently provided; user must configure backups or other mechanisms. | Zone-level disaster recovery is built-in. | Region or global disaster recovery provided by default. |
| **Use Case**             | Zone-specific, latency-sensitive applications. | Mission-critical regional workloads requiring high availability. | Global-scale or highly critical workloads needing continuous availability. |
| **Provided Capabilities**| Basic resource availability within a single zone. | Automatic failover and data replication across zones. | Seamless failover, global distribution, and fault tolerance. |
| **Examples**             | - Virtual Machines (VMs) with zone placement<br>- Managed Disks in a zone. | - Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)<br>- Azure Load Balancer (Zone-redundant). | - Azure Traffic Manager<br>- Azure DNS<br>- Azure Active Directory (AAD). |



Here’s a breakdown of **when to use each service type** based on typical scenarios:

#### **When to Use Zonal Services**
- **Low-Latency, Zone-Specific Applications**: When you need predictable, low-latency performance for workloads tied to a specific Availability Zone.
  - Example: A database or application server that needs to stay close to specific resources in the same zone.
- **Cost-Sensitive Deployments**: When cost considerations outweigh the need for high availability, as deploying zonal services is generally cheaper.
- **Testing and Development**: For workloads that do not require high availability, such as non-critical development, testing, or staging environments.
- **Manual High Availability Architectures**: When you plan to implement your own redundancy and failover mechanisms across zones or regions.


#### **When to Use Zone-Redundant Services**
- **Mission-Critical Regional Applications**: For applications where downtime due to zone failures is unacceptable, and you require high availability within a single Azure region.
  - Example: A web application with a regional user base needing automatic failover across Availability Zones.
- **Data Resiliency Requirements**: For workloads that need built-in data replication and fault tolerance within a region.
  - Example: Storing critical data in Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS).
- **No Manual Management of Redundancy**: When you prefer Azure to handle replication and availability across zones without requiring manual configuration.
- **Scalable and Resilient Services**: For applications such as containerized workloads on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or high-traffic APIs behind a Zone-Redundant Load Balancer.


### **When to Use Always-Available Services**
- **Global Applications**: For applications or services with a global user base that require consistent availability and performance across multiple regions.
  - Example: Authentication services with Azure Active Directory (AAD) or content delivery with Azure CDN.
- **Maximum Availability Requirements**: When downtime is not acceptable, even during region-wide outages, and you need Azure to ensure continuous operation.
  - Example: DNS services with Azure DNS or global traffic routing with Azure Traffic Manager.
- **Simplified Operations**: For scenarios where you want Azure to fully manage availability, failover, and disaster recovery without requiring additional setup.
  - Example: Hosting a global e-commerce site with Azure Front Door for seamless failover.
- **Disaster Recovery Across Regions**: When you want built-in disaster recovery spanning multiple regions without implementing it yourself.

#### **Quick Decision Guide**
- **Zonal Services**: Use for **low latency**, cost efficiency, and zone-specific workloads.
- **Zone-Redundant Services**: Use for **high availability within a region** and to protect against zone failures.
- **Always-Available Services**: Use for **global-scale workloads**, critical applications, or to minimize operational overhead for disaster recovery and failover.

## Data Centers and Resources
- To create and use Azure services, you need an Azure subscription.
- When you're working with your own applications and business needs, you need to create an Azure account, and a subscription will be created for you. After you've created an Azure account, you're free to create additional subscriptions. For example, your company might use a single Azure account for your business and separate subscriptions for development, marketing, and sales departments. After you've created an Azure subscription, you can start creating Azure resources within each subscription.
### Data Centers
- Physical facilities containing hardware, power, cooling, networking infrastructure, and climate control.
- Each region contains at least two data centers.

### Resource
- A resource is the basic building block of Azure. Anything you create, provision, deploy, etc. is a resource. Virtual Machines (VMs), virtual networks, databases, cognitive services, etc. are all considered resources within Azure.
### Resource Groups
- **Resource**: Any entity created in Azure, like VMs, storage, or databases.
- **Resource Group (RG)**: A logical container to organize resources.
  - Allows for cost management, easy deployment, and deletion of resources.
  - Tags in RGs improve billing visibility and organization.
  - Resource groups are simply groupings of resources. When you create a resource, you’re required to place it into a resource group. While a resource group can contain many resources, a single resource can only be in one resource group at a time. Some resources may be moved between resource groups, but when you move a resource to a new group, it will no longer be associated with the former group. Additionally, resource groups can't be nested, meaning you can’t put resource group B inside of resource group A.

### Azure subscriptions
- In Azure, subscriptions are a unit of management, billing, and scale. Similar to how resource groups are a way to logically organize resources, subscriptions allow you to logically organize your resource groups and facilitate billing.
- A subscription provides you with authenticated and authorized access to Azure products and services. It also allows you to provision resources. An Azure subscription links to an Azure account, which is an identity in Microsoft Entra ID or in a directory that Microsoft Entra ID trusts.
-  In a multi-subscription account, you can use the subscriptions to configure different billing models and apply different access-management policies. You can use Azure subscriptions to define boundaries around Azure products, services, and resources. **There are two types of subscription boundaries that you can use**:
  - **Billing boundary**: This subscription type determines how an Azure account is billed for using Azure. You can create multiple subscriptions for different types of billing requirements. Azure generates separate billing reports and invoices for each subscription so that you can organize and manage costs.
  - **Access control boundary**: Azure applies access-management policies at the subscription level, and you can create separate subscriptions to reflect different organizational structures. An example is that within a business, you have different departments to which you apply distinct Azure subscription policies. This billing model allows you to manage and control access to the resources that users provision with specific subscriptions. 
### Management Groups
- Resources are gathered into resource groups, and resource groups are gathered into subscriptions.
- If you have many subscriptions, you might need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions. Azure management groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions. You organize subscriptions into containers called management groups and apply governance conditions to the management groups. All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group, the same way that resource groups inherit settings from subscriptions and resources inherit from resource groups. Management groups give you enterprise-grade management at a large scale, no matter what type of subscriptions you might have. Management groups can be nested.
  - 10,000 management groups can be supported in a single directory.
  - A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth. This limit doesn't include the root level or the subscription level.
  - Each management group and subscription can support only one parent.
- Used to organize multiple subscriptions under a single management umbrella.
  - Example structure: 
    - Sales Dept - MG
        - Sub1
        - Sub2
    - IT Dept - MG
        - IT Sub
        - Dev MGt Group - MG
            - Sub1
            - Sub2
    - Training Dept - MG
        - Sub1
        - Sub2

## Azure Compute and Networking Services

### Compute
- **Definition**: Cloud services utilizing CPU and memory.

**Containers**:
- Virtualization method providing isolated environments for applications.
- Built from an image containing everything required to run the app.
- Containers are managed using container runtimes and images.

---

### Azure virtual machines
- VMs provide infrastructure as a service (IaaS) in the form of a virtualized server and can be used in many ways.
- VMs are an ideal choice when you need:
  - Total control over the operating system (OS).
  - The ability to run custom software.
  - To use custom hosting configurations
- Scale VMs in Azure:
  - **Virtual machine scale sets** let you create and manage a group of identical, load-balanced VMs.
  - Scale sets allow you to centrally manage, configure, and update a large number of VMs in minutes. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand, or you can set it to scale based on a defined schedule. Virtual machine scale sets also automatically deploy a load balancer to make sure that your resources are being used efficiently.
- Virtual machine availability sets are another tool to help you build a more resilient, highly available environment. Availability sets are designed to ensure that VMs stagger updates and have varied power and network connectivity, preventing you from losing all your VMs with a single network or power failure.
  - Availability accomplish these objectives by grouping VMs in two ways: update domain and fault domain.
    - **Update domain**: The update domain groups VMs that can be rebooted at the same time. This setup allows you to apply updates while knowing that only one update domain grouping is offline at a time. All of the machines in one update domain update. An update group going through the update process is given a 30-minute time to recover before maintenance on the next update domain starts.
    - **Fault domain**: The fault domain groups your VMs by common power source and network switch. By default, an availability set splits your VMs across up to three fault domains. This helps protect against a physical power or networking failure by having VMs in different fault domains (thus being connected to different power and networking resources).

#### Resources required for VMs

*   Virtual network interfaces
*   virtual network
*   disk
*   public IP Address.
*   network sercurity Group
*   Virtual Machine
*   When you provision a VM, you’ll also have the chance to pick the resources that are associated with that VM, including:
  *   Size (purpose, number of processor cores, and amount of RAM)
  *   Storage disks (hard disk drives, solid state drives, etc.)
  *   Networking (virtual network, public IP address, and port configuration)





---

#### Azure containers
- VMs are limited to a single operating system per virtual machine. If you want to run multiple instances of an application on a single host machine, containers are an excellent choice.
- Containers are a virtualization environment. Much like running multiple virtual machines on a single physical host, you can run multiple containers on a single physical or virtual host.
- It's possible to create and deploy virtual machines as application demand increases, but containers are a lighter weight, more agile method. Containers are designed to allow you to respond to changes on demand. With containers, you can quickly restart if there's a crash or hardware interruption. One of the most popular container engines is Docker, and Azure supports Docker.
- **Azure Container** Instances offer the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure; without having to manage any virtual machines or adopt any additional services. _Azure Container Instances are a platform as a service (**PaaS**) offering_. Azure Container Instances allow you to upload your containers and then the service runs the containers for you.
- **Azure Container Apps** are similar in many ways to a container instance. They allow you to get up and running right away, they remove the container management piece, and they're a PaaS offering. Container Apps have extra benefits such as the ability to incorporate load balancing and scaling.
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** is a container orchestration service. An orchestration service manages the lifecycle of containers. When you're deploying a fleet of containers, AKS can make fleet management simpler and more efficient.
- Containers are often used to create solutions by using a microservice architecture. This architecture is where you break solutions into smaller, independent pieces. For example, you might split a website into a container hosting your front end, another hosting your back end, and a third for storage. This split allows you to separate portions of your app into logical sections that can be maintained, scaled, or updated independently. Imagine your website back-end reaches capacity, but the front end and storage aren't stressed. With containers, you could scale the back-end separately to improve performance. If something necessitated such a change, you could also choose to change the storage service or modify the front end without impacting any of the other components.

#### Azure Functions
- _**Azure Functions** is an event-driven, serverless compute option_ that doesn’t require maintaining virtual machines or containers. If you build an app using VMs or containers, those resources have to be “running” in order for your app to function. With Azure Functions, an event wakes the function, alleviating the need to keep resources provisioned when there are no events.
- Using Azure Functions is ideal when you're only concerned about the code running your service and not about the underlying platform or infrastructure.
- Functions are commonly used when you need to perform work in response to an event (often via a REST request), timer, or message from another Azure service, and when that work can be completed quickly, within seconds or less.
- Functions scale automatically based on demand, so they may be a good choice when demand is variable.
- Azure Functions runs your code when it triggers and automatically deallocates resources when the function is finished. In this model, Azure only charges you for the CPU time used while your function runs.
- Functions can be either stateless or stateful. When they're stateless (the default), they behave as if they restart every time they respond to an event. When they're stateful (called _Durable Functions_), a context is passed through the function to track prior activity.



### Application hosting options

Looking for options to host applications on Azure.

#### **Azure App Service**
- Azure App Service is a **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** offering to quickly create and host web applications in the cloud.
- App Service enables you to build and host web apps, background jobs, mobile back-ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure.
- **Features**:
  - Fully managed platform for running and scaling applications effortlessly.
  - Build powerful web, mobile, and API apps using multiple programming languages of your choice.
  - Offers **auto-scaling** and **high availability**.
  - Enables automated deployments from multiple sources like GitHub, Azure DevOps, etc.
  - App Service names must be **unique globally**, as they are part of the DNS name.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile backends.

---

#### **App Service Plan**
An App Service Plan defines the compute resources for your App Service applications.  
- **Key Points**:
  - Determines the scaling capacity and pricing.
  - Multiple web apps in the same plan share the same Virtual Machines (VMs), and scaling applies collectively.
  - Use **Autoscale** to adjust based on consumption.
- **Details**:
  - Represents physical compute resources, acting like a shared VM.
  - Billing is consolidated for all apps in the same plan.
  - Defined by:
    - Operating System (Windows, Linux)
    - Region (e.g., West US, East US)
    - Number of VM instances
    - VM instance size (Small, Medium, Large)
    - Pricing tier (e.g., Free, Shared, Standard, PremiumV3)
  - Pricing tiers include:
    - **Shared Compute**: For development/testing (Free/Shared tiers).
    - **Dedicated Compute**: Higher tiers like Standard or Premium offer dedicated VMs and additional features.
    - **Isolated**: Provides compute and network isolation (Isolated/IsolatedV2).

---

#### **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) simplifies Kubernetes adoption.  
- **Key Features**:
  - **Managed Control Plane**: Azure manages the Kubernetes master nodes.
  - **Kubernetes Nodes**: These are the VMs running containers.
  - Easy to set up and eliminates the need for managing Kubernetes infrastructure manually.

---

#### **Virtual Networking (VNet)**
- Azure virtual networks and virtual subnets enable Azure resources, such as VMs, web apps, and databases, to communicate with each other, with users on the internet, and with your on-premises client computers.
- Virtual Networks (VNets) allow isolation and segmentation of Azure resources.
- Azure virtual networking supports both public and private endpoints to enable communication between external or internal resources with other internal resources.
  - Public endpoints have a public IP address and can be accessed from anywhere in the world.
  - Private endpoints exist within a virtual network and have a private IP address from within the address space of that virtual network.
- Azure virtual networks provide the following key networking capabilities:
  - Isolation and segmentation
  - Internet communications
  - Communicate between Azure resources
  - Communicate with on-premises resources
  - Route network traffic
  - Filter network traffic
  - Connect virtual networks
- **Subnetting Example**:
  - Web-tier: `10.0.1.0/24`
  - Middle-tier: `10.0.2.0/24`
  - Data-tier: `10.0.3.0/24`
- **Rules**:
  - Middle-tier can only communicate with Data-tier.
  - Web-tier is the only subnet exposed to the internet.
- **VNet Peering**:
  - Connects VNets, enabling private communication without encryption.
  - Can occur within or across regions (called **Global VNet Peering**).

---

### Azure virtual private networks
- A virtual private network (VPN) uses an encrypted tunnel within another network. VPNs are typically deployed to connect two or more trusted private networks to one another over an untrusted network (typically the public internet). Traffic is encrypted while traveling over the untrusted network to prevent eavesdropping or other attacks.


#### **Azure VPN Gateway**
- Creates secure connections between Azure VNets and other networks.
- A VPN gateway is a type of virtual network gateway. Azure VPN Gateway instances are deployed in a dedicated subnet of the virtual network.
- All data transfer is encrypted inside a private tunnel as it crosses the internet. You can deploy only one VPN gateway in each virtual network. However, you can use one gateway to connect to multiple locations, which includes other virtual networks or on-premises datacenters.
- **Connection Types**:
  - **VNet-to-VNet**: Connects two Azure VNets.
  - **Site-to-Site**: Connects an Azure VNet to an external network.
  - **Point-to-Site**: Connects individual devices (e.g., laptops) to Azure VNets.
- **Limitations**:
  - Speed capped at **1.5 Gbps**.
  - Costs apply for encrypted traffic.
  - Use **Peering** instead of VPN Gateway for lower latency between VNets.
- If you’re configuring a VPN to keep your information safe, you also want to be sure that it’s a highly available and fault tolerant VPN configuration.
  - VPN gateways are deployed as two instances in an **active/standby configuration**, even if you only see one VPN gateway resource in Azure. When planned maintenance or unplanned disruption affects the active instance, the standby instance automatically assumes responsibility for connections without any user intervention. Connections are interrupted during this failover, but they typically restore within a few seconds for planned maintenance and within 90 seconds for unplanned disruptions.
  - With the introduction of support for the BGP routing protocol, you can also deploy VPN gateways in an **active/active configuration**. In this configuration, you assign a unique public IP address to each instance. You then create separate tunnels from the on-premises device to each IP address.
  - In regions that support availability zones, VPN gateways and ExpressRoute gateways can be deployed in a zone-redundant configuration. This configuration brings resiliency, scalability, and higher availability to virtual network gateways. Deploying gateways in Azure availability zones physically and logically separates gateways within a region while protecting your on-premises network connectivity to Azure from zone-level failures.


#### **Azure DNS**
- Azure DNS simplifies DNS record management.
- Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution by using Microsoft Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.
- **Zone Types**:
  - **Public Zones**: Internet-facing domains.
  - **Private Zones**: Domains used within Azure VNets.

---


---

#### **Azure ExpressRoute**
- Provides high-speed, private connectivity between on-premises resources and Azure.
- Azure ExpressRoute lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection, with the help of a connectivity provider. This connection is called an ExpressRoute Circuit. With ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365. This feature allows you to connect offices, datacenters, or other facilities to the Microsoft cloud.  
- **Key Points**:
  - Speeds up to **100 Gbps** via **ExpressDirect**.
  - Traffic bypasses the internet and uses private fiber.
  - Connected via Microsoft Enterprise Edge Routers (MSEE) through third-party providers.

---

### Azure storage accounts

- A storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that's accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS.
- When you create your storage account, you’ll start by picking the storage account type. The type of account determines the storage services and redundancy options and has an impact on the use cases. Below is a list of redundancy options that will be covered later in this module:
  - Locally redundant storage (LRS)
  - Geo-redundant storage (GRS)
  - Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)
  - Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)
  - Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)
  - Read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS).
  - 
| Type                       | Supported Services                           | Redundancy Options                    | Usage                                                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Standard general-purpose v2| Blob Storage (including Data Lake Storage), Queue Storage, Table Storage, and Azure Files | LRS, GRS, RA-GRS, ZRS, GZRS, RA-GZRS | Standard storage account type for blobs, file shares, queues, and tables. Recommended for most scenarios using Azure Storage. If you want support for network file system (NFS) in Azure Files, use the premium file shares account type. |
| Premium block blobs        | Blob Storage (including Data Lake Storage)  | LRS, ZRS                              | Premium storage account type for block blobs and append blobs. Recommended for scenarios with high transaction rates or that use smaller objects or require consistently low storage latency. |
| Premium file shares        | Azure Files                                 | LRS, ZRS                              | Premium storage account type for file shares only. Recommended for enterprise or high-performance scale applications. Use this account type if you want a storage account that supports both Server Message Block (SMB) and NFS file shares. |
| Premium page blobs         | Page blobs only                             | LRS                                   | Premium storage account type for page blobs only.                                                                                                                  |

#### Redundancy in the primary region
  - Data in an Azure Storage account is always replicated three times in the primary region. Azure Storage offers two options for how your data is replicated in the primary region, locally redundant storage (LRS) and zone-redundant storage (ZRS).
    - **Locally redundant storage (LRS)** replicates your data three times within a single data center in the primary region. LRS provides at least 11 nines of durability (99.999999999%) of objects over a given year.
      - LRS is the lowest-cost redundancy option and offers the least durability compared to other options. LRS protects your data against server rack and drive failures. However, if a disaster such as fire or flooding occurs within the data center, all replicas of a storage account using LRS may be lost or unrecoverable.
    - For Availability _Zone-enabled Regions_, **Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)** replicates your Azure Storage data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region. ZRS offers durability for Azure Storage data objects of at least 12 nines (99.9999999999%) over a given year.
      - With ZRS, your data is still accessible for both read and write operations even if a zone becomes unavailable.
      - If a zone becomes unavailable, Azure undertakes networking updates, such as DNS repointing.
      - Microsoft recommends using ZRS in the primary region for scenarios that require high availability.
        
#### Redundancy in a secondary region
  - For applications requiring high durability, you can choose to additionally copy the data in your storage account to a secondary region that is hundreds of miles away from the primary region. If the data in your storage account is copied to a secondary region, then your data is durable even in the event of a catastrophic failure that prevents the data in the primary region from being recovered.
  - Azure Storage offers two options for copying your data to a secondary region: geo-redundant storage (GRS) and geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS). GRS is similar to running LRS in two regions, and GZRS is similar to running ZRS in the primary region and LRS in the secondary region.
  - By default, data in the secondary region isn't available for read or write access unless there's a failover to the secondary region. If the primary region becomes unavailable, you can choose to fail over to the secondary region. After the failover has completed, the secondary region becomes the primary region, and you can again read and write data.

  - **Geo-redundant storage**
    - GRS copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region using LRS. It then copies your data asynchronously to a single physical location in the secondary region (the region pair) using LRS.
    - GRS offers durability for Azure Storage data objects of at least 16 nines (99.99999999999999%) over a given year.
  - **Geo-zone-redundant storage**
    - Data in a GZRS storage account is copied across three Azure availability zones in the primary region (similar to ZRS) and is also replicated to a secondary geographic region, using LRS, for protection from regional disasters.
    - Microsoft recommends using GZRS for applications requiring maximum consistency, durability, and availability, excellent performance, and resilience for disaster recovery.
    - GZRS is designed to provide at least 16 nines (99.99999999999999%) of durability of objects over a given year.

  - Geo-redundant storage (with GRS or GZRS) replicates your data to another physical location in the secondary region to protect against regional outages. However, that data is available to be read only if the customer or Microsoft initiates a failover from the primary to secondary region. However, if you enable read access to the secondary region, your data is always available, even when the primary region is running optimally. For read access to the secondary region, enable read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) or read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS).
  - _Remember that the data in your secondary region may not be up-to-date due to RPO._
 

#### **Azure Storage**
- Azure Storage platform includes the following data services:
  - **Blob Storage**: Stores unstructured data (e.g., images, videos). A massively scalable object store for text and binary data.
    - Types:
      - **Block Blobs**: General-purpose files.
      - **Append Blobs**: Ideal for logs.
      - **Page Blobs**: Stores VHD files for VMs.
    - Access tiers:
      - **Hot access tier**: Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently (for example, images for your website).
      - **Cool access tier**: Optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days (for example, invoices for your customers).
      - **Cold access tier**: Optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 90 days.
      - **Archive access tier**: Appropriate for data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days, with flexible latency requirements (for example, long-term backups).
  - **Azure Disks**: Persistent storage for VMs (HDD/SSD). Block-level storage volumes for Azure VMs.
  - **Azure Files**: SMB-based file storage for shared network access. Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments.
  - **Azure Queues**: A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components.
  - **Azure Tables**: NoSQL table option for structured, non-relational data.

**Storage Tiers**:
- **Hot**: Frequently accessed data (high storage cost, low access cost).
- **Cool access tier**: Optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days (for example, invoices for your customers).
- **Cold**: Infrequently accessed (low storage cost, higher access cost).
- **Archive**: Long-term storage with low cost but requires hydration (up to 15 hours).

#### Azure data migration options

**Azure Migrat**e is a service that helps you migrate from an on-premises environment to the cloud. Azure Migrate functions as a hub to help you manage the assessment and migration of your on-premises datacenter to Azure.

**Azure Data Box** is a physical migration service that helps transfer large amounts of data in a quick, inexpensive, and reliable way. The secure data transfer is accelerated by shipping you a proprietary Data Box storage device that has a maximum usable storage capacity of 80 terabytes. The Data Box is transported to and from your datacenter via a regional carrier. A rugged case protects and secures the Data Box from damage during transit.


#### Azure file movement options
- Azure also has tools designed to help you move or interact with individual files or small file groups. Among those tools are **AzCopy**, **Azure Storage Explorer**, and **Azure File Sync**.
- **AzCopy** is a command-line utility that you can use to copy blobs or files to or from your storage account. With AzCopy, you can upload files, download files, copy files between storage accounts, and even synchronize files. AzCopy can even be configured to work with other cloud providers to help move files back and forth between clouds.
  - Synchronizing blobs or files with AzCopy is one-direction synchronization. When you synchronize, you designated the source and destination, and AzCopy will copy files or blobs in that direction.
- **Azure Storage Explorer** is a standalone app that provides a graphical interface to manage files and blobs in your Azure Storage Account. It works on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems and uses AzCopy on the backend to perform all of the file and blob management tasks.
- **Azure File Sync** is a tool that lets you centralize your file shares in Azure Files and keep the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of a Windows file server. It’s almost like turning your Windows file server into a miniature content delivery network. Once you install Azure File Sync on your local Windows server, it will automatically stay bi-directionally synced with your files in Azure.

#### **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**

Azure AD provides identity and access management.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Authentication (AuthN) and Authorization (AuthZ).
  - Supports internal, external, and third-party resources.
  - **MFA**: Multi-Factor Authentication using two out of:
    - Password
    - Trusted device
    - Biometric (fingerprint/face scan)
  - **Managed Identities**: For Azure resource authentication without secrets.
  - **SSO**: Enables Single Sign-On for apps.

**Entra ID Features**:
- **Azure AD Connect**: Syncs on-prem AD with Azure AD.
- **Conditional Access**: Evaluates user, location, and device signals during authentication.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assigns permissions based on roles and scope.

---

#### **Azure Cost Management**
- **Consumption-Based Model**:
  - Influenced by factors like meters, region, and resource type.
  - Tools like **Pricing Calculator** and **TCO Calculator** help estimate costs.
- **Post-Purchase Tools**:
  - **Cost Management and Billing**: Tracks expenses and optimizes spending.
  - **Budgets and Alerts**: Monitor and set limits for resource costs.
  - **Tags**: Categorize and track resources effectively for billing and management. 

---

#### Features and Tools for Governance and Compliance

##### Azure Blueprints
- Provides easy reuse of configurations, policies, governance, and complex deployments in reusable, deployable packages.
- Can contain multiple artifacts, such as:
  - Resource Groups (RGs)
  - ARM templates
  - Azure Policy assignments
  - RBAC role assignments
- Blueprints are saved in a Subscription or Management Group (MG) and can be assigned to deploy everything defined in the blueprint.
- **Workflow of Azure Blueprint**:
  1. **Create**: Define the blueprint with required artifacts.
  2. **Publish**: Publish the blueprint to an MG or Subscription, making it available for assignment.
  3. **Assign**: Assign the blueprint to an MG or Subscription. Once assigned, all resources defined in the blueprint are automatically created.
- **Key Notes**:
  - MGs can only contain other MGs or Subscriptions.
  - When creating a blueprint under an MG, you must define the target Subscription where resources will be created.

##### Azure Policy
- A governance service to define and enforce rules for Azure resource creation and management.
- **Policy Rules Examples**:
  - All VMs must be of a certain size.
  - All resources must be deployed in specific regions.
  - If a resource is deployed, a related resource must also be deployed.
- **Policy Effects**:
  - **Append**: Adds additional properties to a resource (e.g., automatically adds tags to resources).
  - **Audit**: Logs a warning if the policy is not followed.
  - **AuditIfNotExists**: Logs a warning if a related resource is missing.
  - **DeployIfNotExists**: Deploys a related resource if it doesn't exist.
  - **Deny**: Blocks create or update operations that violate the policy.
  - **Disabled**: Disables the policy (not in effect).

##### Resource Locks
- Prevent accidental deletion or modification of Azure resources.
- Unlike RBAC, which is role-based, locks apply to **all users**.
- Types of Locks:
  - **CanNotDelete**: Prevents resource deletion.
  - **ReadOnly**: Prevents modifications to the resource.

---

#### Features and Tools for Managing and Deploying Resources

##### Azure Portal
- **Customization**:
  - Change portal appearance through **Settings -> Appearance**.
  - Create and customize **Dashboards** for monitoring resources like VMs, Web Apps, etc.

Looking for what options we have for hosting applications.

Azure App Service:
Is a PaaS service which can be used to quickly create and host web app in the cloud.
The App Services in Azure is a PAAS offering. It is a fully managed platform allowing you to run ad scale your applications effortlessly. You can quickly build powerful web, mobile and API apps using the different programming language of your choice. It offers auto-scaling and high availability and enables automated deployments from multiple sources.
App service name has to be unique across all azure app services, because its a DNS name.

App Service Plan:
Can define a plan to scale a webapp. Depends on the service plan the scaling capacity will be defined.
If we have 2 web apps part in the same service plan will be running in the same VMs. So the scalling will apply of all the web apps running in the service plan.
Use Autoscale to scale out/in based on consumption.

All the VMs in the service plans are exact copies of eachother along with the applciatons.
App Service Plan represents the collection of physical resources for the App Service. An App Service Plan can have multiple web apps. In other words, we can have multiple web apps in an app service plan. We can consider an App Service Plan as a single compute resource, i.e., a Virtual Machine. Therefore, for the billing purposes, if we create more than one web apps in a single App Service Plan, we will be charged only once. 

An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run.
When you create an App Service plan in a certain region (for example, West Europe), a set of compute resources is created for that plan in that region. Whatever apps you put into this App Service plan run on these compute resources as defined by your App Service plan. Each App Service plan defines:

Operating System (Windows, Linux)
Region (West US, East US, and so on)
Number of VM instances
Size of VM instances (Small, Medium, Large)
Pricing tier (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3, Isolated, IsolatedV2)
The pricing tier of an App Service plan determines what App Service features you get and how much you pay for the plan. The pricing tiers available to your App Service plan depend on the operating system selected at creation time. These are the categories of pricing tiers:

Shared compute: Free and Shared, the two base tiers, run an app on the same Azure VM as other App Service apps, including apps of other customers. These tiers allocate CPU quotas to each app that runs on the shared resources, and the resources cannot scale out. These tiers are intended to be used only for development and testing purposes.
Dedicated compute: The Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, and PremiumV3 tiers run apps on dedicated Azure VMs. Only apps in the same App Service plan share the same compute resources. The higher the tier, the more VM instances that are available to you for scale-out.
Isolated: The Isolated and IsolatedV2 tiers run dedicated Azure VMs on dedicated Azure virtual networks. They provide network isolation on top of compute isolation to your apps. They provide the maximum scale-out capabilities.
Each tier also provides a specific subset of App Service features. These features include custom domains and TLS/SSL certificates, autoscaling, deployment slots, backups, Traffic Manager integration, and more. The higher the tier, the more features that are available. 



Azure K8s service:
AKS is the MS implementation of K8s in the cloud. Makes it very easy to adopt k8s, we dont have to manage it ourelves.
Primary computer called the control plane, that controls the cluster
Kubernets Nodes, which are the computers that run the containers.


Virtual Networking:

We can define VNet as 10.0.0.0/16 
Subnets: 10.0.1.0/24 Web-tier
Subnets: 10.0.2.0/24 Middle-tier
Subnets: 10.0.3.0/24 Data-tier

we can have rules that only Middle tier can talk to Data tier
also Web-tier is the onely subnet that will be available to the internet.

network peering
Allows connection between two VNets.
Once conneted, the trafic travels vis the private network. Hence peered traffic is not encrypted

Peering can be done between the VNets in the same /diff regions.
If the VNets are in different regions its called "Global Virtual network peering"


Azure DNS:
Makes it easy to manage DNS records in Azure.
Internet-facing zones are called public zones.
Zones used for Azure VNets are called private zones.

Azure VPN gateway:
Makes it easy to create secure connection between Azure VNets and other networks.
Uses a gatway subnet that runs 2 or more VMs
3 types of VPN gateway:
VNet-to-VNet: allows to connect two 2 Azure Vnets.
Site-to-Site: Allows to connect Azure VNet to a Network outside of Azure.
Point-to-Site: Allows a single device like mobile or a computer to a VNet.

The network speed is limited to 1.5 GBytes/Sec. Alos pay for the encrypted network trafic.
Important in case we use VPN gatway instead of Peering to connect two VNets.

Azure ExpressRoute:
Allows to connect Azure resources to on prem resources.
Upto 10 Gbps, is used over dedicated fiber, an up to 100Gbps if used over ExpressDirect.
the traffic donset flow in the internet, but we connect to  MS Enterprise Edge Router (MSEE).
We connet to MSEE via thrid party service provide whos  is usually a internet service provider, which connect directly to MSEE, and MSEE inturn conects to MS network in Azure.
MS call the ExpressRout a circut.


Public and Private Endpoint

Public Eendpoit is a resource which has an IP address that is reachable over the internet.
Private Eendpoit is a resource which has an IP address that is reachable over private network.
we can configure both using the VNet.


Azure Storage:

Blob Storage:
    Used to sote unstructuders blobs, like pictures, audio, vid files.
    Files that are stored in a Blob storage is called a blob.
    Blobs are stored in a container.
    Container can be considerd as a folder, which is a convient way to org blobs and blob storega.
    Types of Blobs:
        Block Blobs: Files that might be used by a application like picures, vids, audio files, documents etc
        Append Blibs: Where we can append to an existing blob. Like a log file.
        Page Blobs: are used sore Virtual hard disk file (VHDs) that are used by VMs.

Azure Disks:
    Stores disks that are used in VMs
    HDD(old) or SSD(Solid state drives)
    When a VM  is created, Aure create a OS disk. But if we want o persisit some data, we need to create a "Data Disk", these DDs are also stored in Azure Disks

Azure Files:
    AF is a SMB-based file system (Server Message Block)
    provides disk space in the cloud.
    Similar to a map drive in the network.
    access these files is slow, as the access is via network. Hence Azure provieds a way to sysn locally via Azure File Sync.


Storage Tier:

Blobs and Azure Blob Storage in these tiers:
The price is by storage and the frequency we access the data.
Hot tier: Often used data. High cost to storage, and low cost for a access.
Cold tier: Data stored for longer periods. Low storage cost, access cost is higher.
    the blob has to be min stored for 30 days, else there will be a penalty.
Archive Tier: Long term storage. Very low cost of storage, and high cost for access. Min time to store the data is 180 days. Before accessing a blob in the archive tire, the blob needs to be moved (hyderated) to Clod/Hot tier before accessing. Can take upto 15hrs to hydrate.



Azure Active Directory:
    Is an AIdentity Service in Azure
    It Authenticates and Authorizes Users
    Once authenticated Azure AD can give acces not only resources in Azure but also 3rd party, and on prem respurces.
    AD can use Service Principles which applications in Active Directory
    Can also use Managed Identities which represent Azure resources.
    Ex: we can use a Managed Identity to give web app access to a VM.


MS Entra ID is the Azure AD service.
Is the managed Active Directi=ory service in Azure.
Features:
    AuthN, AuthZ
    can control internal/external users, anc control access to applications and Asure resources.
    
    Entra MFA: 
        Auth done by:
            Something you know (Password)
            Something you have (trusted device)
            Something you are (finterprint/face scan)
        MFA menas useing 2 of the 3 methods.
    
    Entra self servie password reset: Global Admins cna enable this feature for the users.

    SSO: Can emable applications to use SSO using Entra ID


RBAC: Role based access control

Role assignments:
Who: is the principal
What permissions: Role
Scope: If the permissions are given at the Management Group/Subscription/Resource Group/Resource level.
Recommended scope is the MG scope


MS Entra connect:
    Syncs on perm AD to Azure Entra ID.
    Syncsall user detailsincluding passwords.
    Provides a unified Identity
    Ensures smooth interoperatability between OnPrem and Azure

Entra ID is the toned down version of Active Directory, and iEntra ID does not provide all the services that AD provides.
If we want the AD in Azure, use Microsoft Entra Domain Services.

Entra Conditional Access:
    During AuthN, 3 signal are sent:

        Who by user: userid:
        Localtion the user is logging inf from:
        Device the user is using.


Lesson 8 Describe cost management in Azure:

Consumption based model:
Factors that can impact cost:
    Meters:
        Meters assigned to resources like blob storage capacity and access of data. Ex Hot, Cold, Archive etc.
        VNet peered within the same region cost less that the VNets peered across Regions.
    How we purchse resource:
        Like Reservations, Spot VMs, Hybrid use where we bring our own license.
    Regions
        Some regions are more costilier then others.
    
    Each resource has a pricing page, use it to plan azure deployments.

    Princing Caclualator:
        Estimates Azure resource costs.
        Estimates can be saved and shared.
    Total Cost of Ownerchip (TCO) calculator
        Forcast yout saving by moving from On-prem to Azure
    
    Post Purchase:
    Cost Mangement and Billing
        Can provide the analysis of the amount of money in which region and can give an insight to optimize it.
        Can set a Bugjet and set alerts, can use the scope like Resource Group, which can be monitored.
        Can set Anomaly Alerts and other Cost Alerts
    Tags:
        Name value pairs that can be applies to any Azure Resource.
        Are dsiplayed in invoice.
        Tags can be used to filter resources in All Ressources.
