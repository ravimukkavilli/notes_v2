"I’m Ravi Shankar Mukkavilli, and I have around 20 years of experience in the IT industry, specializing in enterprise application development using Java Enterprise Technologies. 

I started off as a Tester and QA analyst and the move to Developement, abeen a developer since then. I move to the US in 2006, and worked as a consultant there. Came back to India after 12 years in 2019, jsut before CoVID hit. 

Currently, I’m working as a Tech Lead at Workllama, where I’m leading the design and implementation of couple of software modules. Notification Center and Activity Timeline, which enhance recruiter engagement on the platform. The Notification Center provides real-time updates for recruiters, while the Activity Timeline offers an audit trail of changes to important entities like Jobs and Candidates. I implemented this solution using Kafka, Debezium, and Spring Boot, and it has significantly improved transparency and communication for our users.

Throughout my career, I’ve been heavily involved in architectural decision-making and designing integration solutions. I enjoy working on challenging projects that require thoughtful design and best practices to create scalable, efficient systems."

# Tell me about your current project:
----------------------------------------

"In my current role as a Tech Lead at Workllama, I lead the design and implementation of two key components: the Notification Center and the Activity Timeline.

The Notification Center provides real-time updates for recruiters on important events, such as job postings and candidate applications. Currently, we track around 70 events, with more added each sprint. These updates are displayed in a centralized message center under a bell icon, ensuring recruiters are always informed without the need to manually check for updates. This feature saves significant time for recruiters and improves overall company efficiency.

The Activity Timeline functions as an audit trail for various entities like Jobs and Candidates, recording what changes were made, when, and by whom. This visibility is crucial for both compliance and for helping recruiters understand the full history of each entity. The Activity Timeline is also essential for Workllama's transition into an Applicant Tracking System (ATS), aligning us with competitors like Bullhorn who offer similar audit features.

To implement the Activity Timeline, I used Debezium for real-time change data capture, combined with Kafka for event-driven messaging. The overall architecture, built on Java 8, Spring Boot, and MySQL, is designed to be scalable and efficient, capable of handling large volumes of data seamlessly."
