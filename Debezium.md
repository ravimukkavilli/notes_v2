# What is Debezium:
--------------------

Debezium is an open-source, distributed platform that provides change data capture (CDC) functionality. It captures changes in your database (like inserts, updates, and deletes) in real-time and streams them to external systems, like Kafka. It allows applications to react to data changes as they happen, without needing to constantly query the database for updates.

**Key features of Debezium include:**

- **Real-Time Event Streaming:** Debezium continuously monitors your database and streams data change events as they occur, enabling real-time synchronization between databases and other systems.
- **Change Data Capture (CDC):** It captures database changes at a low level (via the database's transaction log) with minimal impact on performance.
- **Support for Multiple Databases:** Debezium supports several databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL Server, and Oracle.
- **Kafka Integration:** Debezium is often used in combination with Apache Kafka, where each database change is published as an event to Kafka topics, allowing for efficient, scalable event-driven systems.
- **Data Integrity and Order:** It ensures that changes are captured in the exact order they happen, preserving transactional integrity.

In summary, Debezium enables applications to respond to data changes in real-time, making it ideal for building modern, event-driven architectures.

# What is a database's transaction log:
----------------------------------------

A database's transaction log is a file that records all the transactions and changes made to the database. It is essential for ensuring data consistency, recovering from crashes, and supporting various database functionalities like replication and backups. Every transaction (like insert, update, or delete) that modifies the data is logged in the transaction log before being committed to the actual database files.

**MySQL (Binlog - Binary Log):**

In MySQL, the binary log (binlog) is a form of transaction log. It records changes to the database in the form of binary events, including statements that modify data (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

**Why and When Does MySQL Recycle Binlogs?**

- **Log Space Management:** Binlog files can grow large over time, especially in databases with high transaction volumes. To prevent them from consuming too much disk space, MySQL is configured to automatically recycle (or remove) older log files. 
  - Suppose you set `expire_logs_days = 7` in your MySQL configuration. This means MySQL will keep the binary logs for the last 7 days. Any logs older than 7 days will be automatically deleted or "recycled."

**Key Concept: Binlog Recycling vs. Log Rotation**

- **Log Rotation:** When a current binlog reaches a certain size, a new binlog is created (rotated), but older logs still remain until they are purged.
- **Log Recycling:** Older logs are removed or deleted once they surpass the retention period or limit, freeing up disk space.

# CDC:
------

Change Data Capture (CDC) is a technique used to identify and track changes in data within a database. The primary goal of CDC is to capture insertions, updates, and deletions as they occur in a source system, and then propagate those changes to downstream systems in real-time or near real-time.
